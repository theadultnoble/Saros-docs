The Saros DLMM SDK is a TypeScript native package for interacting with Saros' Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) on Solana. It provides programmatic access to DLMM pools, enabling the creation and management of positions. DLMM is an enhancement of the original [Saros AMM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saros-finance/sdk), introducing a bin-based architecture that organises liquidity into discrete price bins for concentrated and precise liquidity management.

This guide introduces the **Saros** DLMM SDK, showing you how to set it up and interact programmatically with DLMM pools on Solana.

## Installation

Get started by installing the SDK using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @saros-finance/dlmm-sdk
```

or

```tsx
yarn add @saros-finance/dlmm-sdk
```

Import it into your project:

```tsx
import sarosSDK from "@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk";
const { LiquidityBookServices } = sarosSDK;
```

## Initialise Connection & Services

Connect to Solana and initialise the liquidity service:

```tsx
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const liquidityBookServices = new LiquidityBookServices({ connection });
```

`LiquidityBookServices` provides the core SDK service to query pools, positions, and execute transactions.

You can now start building amazing projects with Saros!

For a complete documentation of the SDK's offerings, see the **[DLMM Technical Reference]()**.

## Next Steps

In the next guide you’ll learn how to execute trades between SPL tokens directly through Saros DLMM. You will leverage its dynamic liquidity management to achieve efficient pricing, reduced slippage, compared to traditional AMMs.
