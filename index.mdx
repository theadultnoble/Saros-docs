Saros offers three development kits, powering Saros' two powerful liquidity engines:

- [**`@saros-finance/sdk`**](https://github.com/saros-xyz/saros-sdk): Provides access to the core Saros AMM functionality, exposing methods to interact with liquidity pools, manage positions, and execute swaps directly through the SDK.
- [**`@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk): Offers integration with Saros DLMM, the newest next-gen liquidity engine. It offers access to Saros bin-based liquidity management, offering benefits not available to traditional AMMs.
- [**`saros-dlmm-sdk-rs`**](https://github.com/saros-xyz/saros-dlmm-sdk-rs): A Rust SDK for Saros DLMM, offering a Rust-native interface for interacting with DLMM pools and operations.

## Saros SDKs Comparison

Here’s a quick breakdown of Saros SDKs. With each optimised for a specific environment, use the table to choose the one that best fits your project.

| SDK                           | Language   | Focus Engine                            | Best For                                      | Key Features                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`saros-finance/sdk`**       | Typescript | [AMM](https://docs.saros.xyz/amm)       | Web apps, dApps, frontend integrations        | Swap, staking, create liquidity pools, add/remove liquidity |
| **`@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk`** | Typescript | [DLMM](https://docs.saros.xyz/readme-2) | Advanced DeFi apps needing LP optimization    | Dynamic price ranges, Auto-adapting liquidity               |
| **`saros-dlmm-sdk-rs`**       | Rust       | DLMM core + native rust dev             | On-chain programs, Rust-based Solana projects | DLMM powered by native Rust                                 |

### Quick Decision Flow

- Want to ship fast a DEX with simple swap staking, farming features? → Use **Saros SDK**.
- Building a trading platform with advanced liquidity solutions and complex markets? → Use **DLMM SDK**.
- Writing on-chain Solana programs with DLMM features? → Use **DLMM SDK Rust**.
