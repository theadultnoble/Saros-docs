Saros offers three development kits, powering Saros' two powerful liquidity engines:

- [**`@saros-finance/sdk`**](https://github.com/saros-xyz/saros-sdk): Provides access to the core Saros AMM functionality, exposing methods to interact with liquidity pools, manage positions, and execute swaps directly through the SDK.
- [**`@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk): Offers integration with Saros DLMM, the newest next-gen liquidity engine. It offers access to Saros bin-based liquidity management, offering benefits not available to traditional AMMs.
- [**`saros-dlmm-sdk-rs`**](https://github.com/saros-xyz/saros-dlmm-sdk-rs): A Rust SDK for Saros DLMM, offering a Rust-native interface for interacting with DLMM pools and operations.

## Saros SDKs Comparison

Here’s a quick breakdown of Saros SDKs. With each optimised for a specific environment, use the table to choose the one that best fits your project.

| SDK                           | Language   | Focus                                       | Best For                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **`saros-finance/sdk`**       | Typescript | General Saros AMM (trading, liquidity mgmt) | Web apps, dApps, frontend integrations        |
| **`@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk`** | Typescript | Dynamic Liquidity AMM (DLMM)                | Advanced DeFi apps needing LP optimization    |
| **`saros-dlmm-sdk-rs`**       | Rust       | DLMM core + Solana-native dev               | On-chain programs, Rust-based Solana projects |

### Quick Decision Flow

- **Building a frontend dApp?** → Use **Saros SDK**.
- **Backend scripting or custom trading bot?** → Use **DLMM SDK**.
- **Writing on-chain Solana programs?** → Use **DLMM SDK Rust**.
